# BlueDMX
Arduino DMX controller with bluetooth android connection

This should be a very simple arduino project which connects via bluetooth to an android phone. 
The android coding is done via MIT App Inventor: http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu

The hardware should contain only 3 parts: Arduino (pro mini) board, HC05 bluetooh module, MAX485 adapter and DMX socket
