# BlueDMX
Arduino DMX controller with bluetooth android connection

This should be a very simple arduino project which connects via bluetooth to an android phone. 
The android app is done via MIT App Inventor: http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu

The hardware should contain only 4 parts: Arduino (pro mini) board, HC05 bluetooh module, MAX485 adapter and DMX socket. Optinally, but recomended is a case. This will keep the hardware costs about 10-20 Euro.

What is it good for?
* Simple lighting without the need of a seperate DMX contoller
* Not for conplex scenes, just simple (static) scenes
* remote control via bluetooth, no additional cabling for control required.
